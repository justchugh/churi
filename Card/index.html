                Babe,
                <br><br>
                Happy 19 months Anniversary! 🥰 Time's literally flown by since our first coffee date; your white and red outfit and that humor, saying you looked like an auntie, just stole my heart 💖. Remember that day you wore the green sweatshirt just for me? Those moments are unforgettable. It’s these little things, you know, that make me realize how incredibly lucky I am to have you. 🍀

                    Every shared adventure, every laugh, every challenge has brought us closer. From savoring chole bhature and pani puri 🍛 to appreciating the simplest moments together, it all means the world to me. Your love for dark chocolates 🍫, pancakes with maple syrup 🥞, and our late-night cuddles are moments I cherish deeply. Our first kiss, our initial date at the old mansion, and celebrating Friendship Day 🎉 have become milestones of our journey, etching the beginning of 'us'.

                    You inspire me to be a better man. Dreaming together, whether it's stargazing from the terrace 🌌 or sneaking around, adds excitement to our bond. Your openness, the thoughtful gifts 🎁, and embracing life's wild moments with a dash of 'Modern Family' humor, have deepened my love and gratitude for you.
                    <br><br>
                    Eighteen months in, and my love for you only grows with each new experience and dream shared. Our story is one I cherish deeply, and I look forward to more adventures, laughter, and love ❤️. 
                    <br><br>
                    Here's to us, Ri, to the beautiful future that awaits.
                    <br><br>
                    With all my heart,
                    Chuchu 💌
